# ZBOSS_extended
ZBOSS packet sniffer extended with injection features for CC2531 hardware by Texas Instruments.

# Description

ZBOSS packet sniffer, https://zboss.dsr-wireless.com/ , allows the usage of the CC2531 as a packet sniffer but it doesn't provide any functionalities regarding the trasmission of packets. ZBOSS_extended extends the ZBOSS packet sniffer firmware, implementing injection capabilities in the firmware and modifying it to support KillerBee framework. KillerBee drivers need to be implemented in order to use this solution.
