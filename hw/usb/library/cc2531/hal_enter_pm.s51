;; Description: Contains functions for entering the power mode selected by
;;              SLEEPCMD.MODE bits (CC253x).
;;              Due to hardware requirements, this function is implemented in
;;              assembler to ensure correct instruction alignment.
;;
;;              The "PCON = 0x01" instruction that enters the power mode will
;;              halt CPU execution. The following instruction will not be
;;              executed until the CPU has been woken up with an interrupt.
;;
;;              For CC253x, it is required to have the instruction AFTER the
;;              "PCON = 0x01" instruction to NOT be on a 4-byte boundary. Since
;;              the "PCON = 0x01" instruction is a 3 byte instruction, the
;;              requirement is fulfilled. See the CC253x User's Guide for more
;;              details.
;;
;;              For the IAR A8051 assembler, the alignment is done with the
;;              "(n)" parameter when specifying segment placement, which will
;;              align it to 2^n byte boundary.
